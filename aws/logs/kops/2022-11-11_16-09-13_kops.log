*********************************************************************************

A new kubernetes version is available: 1.23.13
Upgrading is recommended (try kops upgrade cluster)

More information: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/permalinks/upgrade_k8s.md#1.23.13

*********************************************************************************

kOps has set your kubectl context to tcss702.rgschmitz.com

Cluster is starting.  It should be ready in a few minutes.

Suggestions:
 * validate cluster: kops validate cluster --wait 10m
 * list nodes: kubectl get nodes --show-labels
 * ssh to the master: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@api.tcss702.rgschmitz.com
 * the ubuntu user is specific to Ubuntu. If not using Ubuntu please use the appropriate user based on your OS.
 * read about installing addons at: https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons.
