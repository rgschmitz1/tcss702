# normal and tumor bam files were processed by biobambam2 converting them from bam to fastq
# fastq files were then compressed using:
#   tar -cJf normal.tar.xz normal_1.fq normal_2.fq
#   tar -cJf tumor.tar.xz tumor_1.fq tumor_2.fq

# GDC.h38.d1.vd1 BWA Index Files

# Reference sequence and BWA index files were recompressed using XZ for a smaller package size

# files are included in docker image 'schmitzr1984/tcss702-bwa-mem-reference:latest'
