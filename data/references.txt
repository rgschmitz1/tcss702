# normal and tumor bam files were preprocessed by biobambam converting them from bam to fastq
# fastq files were then compressed using:
#   tar -cJf normal.tar.xz normal_1.fq normal_2.fq
#   tar -cJf tumor.tar.xz tumor_1.fq tumor_2.fq

# Reference sequence and BWA index files were recompressed using XZ for a smaller package size

# all files were included into a docker image 'tcss702-bwa-mem:latest'
